#Go Fib Annotation Task
- Clone this repo
- Move `example.go` to a different folder
- Within the fib folder, run `go test -v --coverprofile=coverage.out`. The tests should pass and coverage should be 100%
- Follow the example in `example.go` for `fib.go`. `example.go` can be run with `go run example.go`
- We will discuss what you came up with at our next session!
